    "about": "I am currently pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Mathematics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. My journey into the world of computer science began unexpectedly during my freshman year of college when I took intro to Java. Originally, I had been majoring in chemistry, but after having an inspiring CS200 professor, I knew I could excel in this field. Thus I becacme a computer science major.\n\n\nWhat I find most intriguing about computer science is the boundless potential for learning. I could spend my entire life exploring various facets, and yet, I will never reach a point where I've learned everything. This perpetual pursuit of knowledge is what fuels my passion for this career.",
